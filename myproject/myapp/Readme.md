The REST API endpoints in the code are used to define the different HTTP methods that can be used to interact with the backend data. In this case, there are two endpoints defined:

WorkList - This endpoint is used to retrieve a list of Work objects. It extends Django's built-in ListAPIView class to provide a GET method that returns a serialized list of Work objects. The queryset attribute is set to retrieve all Work objects, and the serializer_class attribute is set to use the WorkSerializer class to serialize the data. The endpoint also has filter and ordering capabilities using the SearchFilter and OrderingFilter classes provided by Django REST framework.

RegistrationView - This endpoint is used to create a new User object and corresponding Client object. It extends Django's built-in CreateAPIView class to provide a POST method that creates a new User object using the RegistrationSerializer class to validate and deserialize the request body. The permission_classes attribute is set to allow any user to access this endpoint, and the serializer_class attribute is set to use the RegistrationSerializer class to serialize and save the data.

These endpoints can be accessed using HTTP requests to the specified URLs, with the appropriate HTTP method and request data. For example, to retrieve a list of all works, you would make a GET request to the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/works/. To create a new user, you would make a POST request to the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/register with a request body containing the username and password for the new user.
